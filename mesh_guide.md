# Mesh Guide

We use meshes for field logos. Meshes are also often used throughout stadiums, although decals can be used as well. This is a tutorial on how I make mesh logos, using Tulane as an example.
Everyone does things a little differently, and you will find something that works for you, but this is my method. A few notes important notes before we begin:
- Set CanCollide to false for field meshes
- Use RGB color (204, 215, 194) for white field logos as this will match the field lines
- If you need to add outlines to logos or text, square off the corners

### Required Software 
I will be using these programs. There may be other alternatives but they will not be covered in this tutorial.
- Image editing software such as [paint.net](https://getpaint.net/download.html)
- Vector graphics software such as [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
- 3D modeling software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
- ROBLOX Studio

First, find an updated picture of the field:

Next, find pictures of the logos you need to make. https://www.sportslogos.net/ is a good site if you can't find anything. I got this off Google Images:

Next, edit the image to your needs. If you look closely at the midfield logo, there is a blue outline outside of the black outline that is missing in our image.
I added the outline in paint.net and squared off the corners and got this:

Now, meshes on roblox can only be one color, so we will need a separate mesh for each color of the logo: green, blue, black, and white.
