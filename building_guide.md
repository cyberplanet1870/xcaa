# Building Guide

XCAA has a unique style of stadiums that we would like to keep consistent between all of our fields. This is a style guide for how we build our stadiums/fields.

### Stadium Size Guide

- Total dimensions: 430x260
- Play area dimensions: 430x210
- Sideline dimensions: 175x25

It is preferred that you build the stadium entirely out of the 430x260 area if possible.
Depending on the stadium, however, corners of the stands may have to encroach on the field area (such as in the OSU stadium above).
As long as nothing is built in the "DO NOT BUILD" zone shown above, this is okay, but it should be kept to a minimum.

We want to give you a lot of creative freedom on these stadiums, while still matching the style of our stadiums.
These are some example stadiums from around the league. You can see how they are all slightly different yet use the similar brick style. 
Notice how the seats are taller in some stadiums than others (approx 3-4 studs) but the same thickness in all (1 stud).
Some stadiums have seated/non-seated areas (such as USC, images 3/4). 
Stands can also get steeper the further up in the stadium you go (image 3), however, seat size should remain the same in each section. 

The main points for brick seats:
- Seat dimensions: 1 stud thick, 3-4 studs tall
- Seat material: Plastic
- Set CanCollide off for the seats
- Concrete material for stairs/walkways

**TODO: provide an example seat model**
