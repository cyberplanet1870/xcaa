# Building Guide

XCAA has a unique style of stadiums that we would like to keep consistent between all of our fields. This is a style guide for how we build our stadiums/fields.

### Field Size

[Link to field size guide model](https://github.com/cyberplanet1870/xcaa/blob/main/assets/XCAA_Field_Guide.rbxm)

Total size: 423.6 x 249 studs

Do not build anything on the areas within the field guide. You should also aim to give a little extra sideline room where possible, but not too much.
Also, please do not move or rotate the field guide from its inserted position (0, 0.5, 0).

Here is an example of Ohio Stadium with and without the field guide.

### Building Style

**TODO: provide an example seat model**

We want to give you a lot of creative freedom on these stadiums, while still matching the style of our stadiums.
These are some example stadiums from around the league. You can see how they are all slightly different yet use the similar brick style. 
Notice how the seats are taller in some stadiums than others (range from 3-4 studs) but the same thickness in all (1 stud).
Some stadiums have seated/non-seated areas (such as USC, images 3 & 4). 
Stands can also get steeper the further up in the stadium you go (image 3), however, seat size should remain the same in each section. 

The main points for brick seats:
- Seat dimensions: 1 stud thick, 3-4 studs tall
- Seat material: Plastic
- Set CanCollide off for the seats
- Concrete material for stairs/walkways

### Play Clocks

[Link to play clock model](https://github.com/cyberplanet1870/xcaa/blob/main/assets/PlayClock.rbxm)

Some of our stadiums use custom play clocks (see above). You can resize/recolor these to fit your needs, but do not rename the model (SevenSegmentPlayClock) or the Digit1 and Digit2 sub-models.
Place these anywhere within your stadium model.
