# Building Guide

XCAA has a unique style of stadiums that we would like to keep consistent between all of our fields. This is a style guide for how we build our stadiums/fields.

### Stadium Size Guide

- Total dimensions: 420x250
- Play area dimensions: 420x208
- Sideline dimensions: 174x21

It is preferred that you build the stadium entirely out of the 420x250 area if possible.
However, you might have to cut the corners a bit which is okay so long as none of the area in green (2nd pic) is covered.

We want to give you a lot of creative freedom on these stadiums, while still matching the style of our stadiums.
These are some example stadiums from around the league. You can see how they are all slightly different yet use the similar brick style. 
Notice how the seats are taller in some stadiums than others (approx 3-4 studs) but the same thickness in all (1 stud).
Some stadiums have seated/non-seated areas (such as USC, images 3/4). 
Stands can also get steeper the further up in the stadium you go (image 3), however, seat size should remain the same in each section. 

The main points for brick seats:
- Seat dimensions: 1 stud thick, 3-4 studs tall
- Seat material: Plastic
- Set CanCollide off for the seats
- Concrete material for stairs/walkways

**TODO: provide an example seat model**
